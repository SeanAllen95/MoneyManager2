Project Title and Description:

Money Manager - This is my first Python project which is a spending tracker where a user can add merchants, tags and transactions to keep on top of their spending. The user is able to see all of their transactions on one page, they can see a total of their spending and they are able to edit and delete tags, merchants and transactions. 

This application was built using Python, Flask and SQL. Some unit testing has been performed on the transaction, tag and merchant classes.
